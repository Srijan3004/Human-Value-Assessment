# Human-Value-Assessment
This study examines individual differences in Rabindrik value preferences among
a specific age group of 18-28 years old, consisting of 18 males and 17 females.
The research employs both an individual differences approach and a general
comparative study to investigate value preferences within this age group and
compare the findings to existing literature. The primary objective of this study
is to explore the extent to which age and gender influence value preferences
within the 18-28 age group for a particular collected sample of a specified population.
Participants were recruited mostly from Indian Statistical Institute and other
premier institutes, ensuring a representative sample of young adults in the
specified age range. The Rabindrik Value Scale was administered to assess participants’ value preferences.
The results of the individual differences analysis revealed significant variations
in value preferences within the 18-28 age, underscoring the impact of personal
characteristics on the prioritization of values. Moreover, gender differences in
value preferences were observed, indicating that males and females within this
age range emphasize certain values to varying degrees. These findings align
with previous research on gender and value preferences, highlighting gender as
a salient factor in shaping individuals’ value orientations during young adulthood.
The general comparative study compared the value preferences of the 18-28
age group to the existing literature on Rabindrik values. The analysis demonstrated notable similarities and some differences between the current sample
and previous studies on adolescents and young adults, suggesting a consistent
pattern of value preferences among young adults. These findings contribute to
the existing body of literature by confirming the robustness and generalizability
of Rabindrik value patterns within this specific age group.
Overall, this study highlights the significance of individual differences, age, and
gender in shaping value preferences among young adults aged 18-28. The findings shed light on the dynamics of value orientations within this age group
and provide valuable insights for disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and
youth studies. Further research is encouraged to explore additional factors that
may influence value preferences within this age group and to investigate the implications of these preferences in various societal context
